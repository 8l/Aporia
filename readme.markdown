# Aporia
Aporia is an IDE for the Nimrod programming language. Aporia uses GTK as the default toolkit, and the gtksourceview for the text editor component.

## Compiling
To compile Aporia you need the latest version of the Nimrod compiler, preferably the unstable release from github. Aporia sometimes relies on bug fixes which have not yet made it to a stable release.

Once you have a working Nimrod compiler, all you need to do is `nimrod c aporia.nim`
