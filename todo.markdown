# Aporia's Todo list

* <del>When a file is already opened, and it gets opened again. Don't open it again, instead switch to that tab.</del>
* Use threads when executing the compiler.
* <del>Drag and Drop.</del>
* <del>Search and replace for regex, pegs and style insensitive searching.</del>
* Investigate line and cursor position as well as scrolling when restoring a session.
* Read cmd line args to check for file paths.
* Finish the suggest feature.
* <del>Get schemes from /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/schemes</del>
* <del>Add a way to terminate a running (compilation) process</del>
* Investigate why process output isn't "live" and make it "live".
* Add links to line numbers in compiler output.
* Project management.
* Ability to drag and drop tabs around. As well as to drop files onto the GtkNotebook to open a file.
* Ability to split vertically into two separate tab views.
* Useful ways to find functions:
  * Find me all functions that return TypeX
  * Find me all functions that take TypeX as first param.
  * Find me all functions that take TypeX as any param.
  * etc.
* Error list.
* Variable inspection in the editor; being able to hover over a variable and see its type
  * This requires better Nimrod compiler integration!
